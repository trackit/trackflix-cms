* Select Appropriate Region:‚Äã
In the top menu, near your IAM Account User name, select, from the dropdown, the most appropriate region to host your Strapi project. For example, US East (N.Virginia) or Asia Pacific (Hong Kong).

* SSL config:
     * Sudo apt-get install certbot
     * Sudo apt-get install python3-certbot-nginx
